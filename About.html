            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p>Hi I am Morgan Gibrila. I'm 19 years old and was born in France. when I was younger my mother and I moved around quite a lot and lived in several countries (France, Dominican Republic, Martinique, Malta, and now Netherlands) and I've visited many other as it is one of mine and my mothers favourite thing to do. </p>
            <p>Since I have moved around quite a lot I have changed schools several times until I was 14 years old. I started in the french system but at the age of 9 i moved to the english system as my mother saw that i had more opportunity in life by studying in english. The change was hard at the beginning but it got easier quickly. After finishing my school years in Malta I decided to move alone to The Netherlands to Study User Experience Design (UXD) In The Hague. The reason I chose UXD was because I was always a fan of programming and creating something that would be used by thousands or millions of people to help them in someway, I also really like the business side of things and felt that in UXD I could have a bit of both. Currently the aspects I am the most passionate about in my first year of UXD are: prototyping, programming, user interaction, user research, and the persuasive experience, but i would also really enjoy managing but it doesn't seem to be part of the course.</p>
            <p>In the future i want to manage a team of UX designers but still be able to program and apply my research knowledge with a team. One of my biggest dreams would be to own my very own UX design company that work for any company we want; but until this dream becomes a reality my goal is to work for a big UX company and manage my own team of UX designers and work along side my team.</p>
