                <p>For 6 months I worked on the making of Pastry Knight, a rogue-like / dungeon crawler reminiscent adventure that follows the brave Pastry Knight on his tumultuous path to rescuing his daughter, as part of Game development minor. During this period I learnt the programming language C# and work using the game editor Unity.</p>

                <p>In my team I was in charge of designing and coding the any UI / HUD the game had, but I was also involved in: the storytelling of the game, flow of the story, coding some of the game mechanics used in game.</p>

                <p>Once a team was established we all: brainstormed ideas for a story we would like to tell, made a collection of games genre we love, and a collection of games aesthetic we want our game to have.

                <p>We all, in our free time, dote voted on the idea we liked the most and had a call to discuss the direction we wanted to go as a group for the concept art and visuals. </p>

                <p>We ended up with Pastry Knight, a rogue-like / dungeon crawler set in a pastrified (turned into pastry) parallel world following a retired knight on his journey to save his daughter. The knight (player) must smash his way through pastry enemies and advance through the world.</p>

                <p>A list of content needed in the main menu was made by using other popular game&apos;s main menu content as inspiration. With the list done, I asked the concept artists to send me some of the concepts they had made so that i may use it in the menu page.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="main_text_grid_text">
                <p>I then moved on to designing the first mockups of the main menu using Figma (version 1 & 2) but none of them were appealing to me or the team, so after more inspiration and a play test where I got see the other teams games; I made the final version which was very well received in the team.</p>

            <p>I thought that rather than overlay buttons on a background, making use of the background element (in this case the tree trunk) was a much more interesting way to display buttons. It is also something that I have not seen done much. I believe that with more time and game making knowledge the main menu could have pushed the use of the background as a menu even farther.</p>

        <div class="main_text_grid_text">
            <p>The options screen started in the same way as the main menu, we looked around at games we are familiar with and noted down the most common settings. Once I had a good list of settings I sat down with our programming team and checked which settings were feasible to have in the game and which were not. With a list in hand we did card sorting to categories them and be able to screen options accordingly.</p>

                <p>The first version of the options screen was done before the main menu was making use of the background to place buttons, therefore it was made in a way that does not match the final main menu. It made use of a tab system to separate the options. </p>

                <p>To match the main menu, the tree from the background expands to reveal the opinions screen and its different options. Version 2 made use of a tab system but after more discussion with the programming team some of the sections became very empty.

                <p>In version 3 all the options where placed under one single tab and where sectioned off by headers itavoid having tabs with one single option in it.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately due to time constraint we had to cut a lot of the options that were not yet implemented, leaving us with the final options screen iteration.</p>
