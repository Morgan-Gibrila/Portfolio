                <p>There are hundreds of tasks managing apps, but personally they do not really fit my needs. I alwasy have to break my work flow to view my next task, so I'm embarking on an adventure and design my ideal task management app.</p>
                <br>
                <p>In this project I researched and designed my ideal task management app using Figma and will, at a late date, attempt to programme it in swift (the programming language use by macOS).</p>

                <h2>Research</h2>
                <br>
                <p>For this project, the research will mainly be focused on competitor analysis, as this project aims to fill a void left by other task managing apps. I will also interview people who have used or are using these apps to have direct insight from someone who has a hands on experience with them.</p>
                <br>

                <h2>Competitive analysis</h2>
                <br>
                <p>I started by listing all the features of that that: Microsoft to do, Trello, and Kanban extension for obsidian have on in a digital board and color coded them based on the app they are from. Once I had made the list, I clustered the cards into groups of similar features, this helped point out the must have features from the "nice to have".</p>

                <h2>Interviews</h2>
                <br>
                <p>As for the interviews, most people use the calendar app on their device to keep track of what they have to do at certain hours / days for all sorts of activities. Depending on the use, a Kanban alternative is used by some people when it comes to work.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Some people used Obsidian (a markdown language, note taking app), such as an interviewee and myself, other used notion when working on projects. Most are satisfied their choice and the others do not want to go through the hassle of finding an app that solves their minor inconvenience</p>
                <br>

                <h2>My Vision</h2>
                <br>
                <p>Based on the research, not a lot of people in my surrounding have an issue with the way they keep track of tasks. Unfortunately for them this project is mainly to challenge myself. </p>
                <br>
                <p>This app being aimed at a work use, should have a customisable Kanban style space that allows users to add task (visualised by cards) that contain the task, date, tag, and description. As for my personal touch, it should be easily accessible through the menu bar of your computer at all times. </p>
