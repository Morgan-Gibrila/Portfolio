                <p>Project shared spaces aims to create a space that can take full advantage of face-to-face interaction as well as interactive digital technologies. The client, Civic Technology in The Hague University of Applied Sciences, wants to develop a user-centered solution to address the challenge of low citizen engagement in government decision-making processes.</p>

                <h2>Research</h2>

                <p>My team and I, generated a general research aim "Our research aims to investigate new effective approaches to including citizens in the democratic processes and decision making in their area through a hybrid of digital and real life concepts." and selected the appropriate methods to research it.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Interview which allowed us to get to know our target audiences on a deeper level and provide us with a rich amount of data about our users&apos; behavior and attitude, and Questionnaire which helped us reach a greater number of participants as it is easier to spread around and utilize for collecting general feedback from multiple points of view.</p>

                <h2>Design Vision</h2>
                
                <p>Our product will be an environment that provides the necessary needs for people to express their opinions on issues around their neighbourhood.</p>
                <br>
                <p>This space is one that looks inviting and is attractive to all sorts of people, as to encourage them to want to express their opinion and concerns they may have, whilst providing a trust for people to be able to see that what they are providing is contributing to actual change. Use of technology gives it an ease of use and helps connect with the next generation, whilst still being usable for those who may not be familiar with technology.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The space will be advertised around the neighbourhood making use of flyers, posters, and/or online posts, to ensure people are aware of it and are able to participate if wanted. By advertising through several mediums we would be able to reach several target groups. This also means it must be accessible by everyone, therefore it must have the necessary equipment and features to cater to those who may have difficulties in movement.</p>
                <br>

                <h2>The final design</h2>
                <h3>DEMO (Distributable Equipment for Memorable Opining)</h3>

                <p>A portable space that travels to different neighborhoods providing a space for deliberation and discussion for the local community. The space provides its community modern tools to aid in improving the neighborhood with various activities, such as discussions, suggestions and tools for design. The space would showcase changes already achieved in order to gain trust from visitors.</p>
                <br>
                <p>To provide accessibility, an area would be set up for children to play or read whilst their parent participates, a ramp can be set up for people with movement difficulty, and an online space can also be arranged to not exclude those who wish to attend but are unable to.</p>
                <br>
                <p>DEMO would be treated as an event and go from neighborhood to neighborhood, allowing problems to be divided by areas.</p>
