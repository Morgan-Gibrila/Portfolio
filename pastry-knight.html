                <h2>The process</h2>

                <p>Once a team was established we all: brainstormed ideas for a story we would like to tell, made a collection of games genre we love, and a collection of games aesthetic we want our game to have. A mood board was made for the visuals and clusters of story idea were added to a digital board and dote voting was used to select an idea for the story line.</p>

                <h2>Main Menu</h2>

                <p>A list of content needed in the main menu was made by using other popular game&apos;s main menu content as inspiration. With the list done, I asked the concept artists to send me some of the concepts they had made so that i may use it in the menu page.</p>
                <br>
                <p>While playing around with the layout, I inspired myself with several games I play, but a lot of the version I came up with felt like a simple text overlay which I found too basic. After going back to the drawing board I though of using the background to my advantage and use the tree silhouette as a place to place the buttons. </p>

                <h2>Option Screen</h2>

                <p>The options screen started in the same way as the main menu, we looked around at games we are familiar with and noted down the most common settings. Once I had a good list of settings I sat down with our programming team and checked which settings were feasible to have in the game and which were not. With a list in hand we did card sorting to categories them and be able to screen options accordingly.</p>
                <br>
                <p>To match the main menu, the tree from the background expands to reveal the opinions screen and its different options. Version 2 made use of a tab system but after more discussion with the programming team some of the sections became very empty.In version 3 all the options where placed under one single tab and where sectioned off by headers, it avoided having tabs with one single option in it.</p>

                <h2>Pause Menu & death screen</h2>

                <p>The pause screen uses the same idea of placing the buttons on the tree trunk. Since there was no background, I decided to use the current freeze frame of the game and blurring it; this help separate the game from the menu and give a layered feel.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I felt it was necessary to have a proper death screen, it helps the player know what is going on. Rather than just teleporting them to the beginning and resetting the game, we gave them a moment to realise what happened. The screen was kept very simple so I only gave them the option to retry or to leave the main menu.</p>

                <h2>HUD</h2>

                <p>The process for the HUD (heads-up display) followed the same method as the other UI elements. I looked at inspirations from other games and tried things out.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The ability icons where the only thing we were sure from the start as to where they would be placed, I  focused on how to show the health. I got inspired by a game called Elden Ring and their ways of displaying the health and mana of the player.</p>

                <p>This was a very fun project to work on with my class mates. I learnt a lot by exploring things by myself, I developed my skills as a UI designer but also got to learn a new programming language. I experience working in a team, having to communicate changes to other.</p>
