            <h1>Pastry Knight</h1>

            <p>For 6 months I worked on the making of Pastry Knight, a rogue-like / dungeon crawler reminiscent adventure that follows the brave Pastry Knight on his tumultuous path to rescuing his daughter, as part of Game development minor. During this period I learnt the programming language C# and work using the game editor Unity.</p>
            
            <p>In my team I was in charge of designing and coding the any UI / HUD the game had, but I was also involved in: the storytelling of the game, flow of the story, coding some of the game mechanics used in game.</p>

            <h2>The process</h2>
            <p>Once a team was established we all: brainstormed ideas for a story we would like to tell, made a collection of games genre we love, and a collection of games aesthetic we want our game to have.</p>
            <p>Everyone added their ideas to digital board and a mood word was made for the visuals, but also clusters of story idea were made. </p>
            <p>We all, in our free time, dote voted on the idea we liked the most and had a call to discuss the direction we wanted to go as a group for the concept art and visuals. </p>

            <div id="project-image-group">
                <img class="project-image" src="images/PastryKnight/Pastry Knight Miro Mood board.png" alt="">
                <img class="project-image" src="images/PastryKnight/Pastry Knight Dote Voting.png" alt="">
            </div>

            <p>We ended up with Pastry Knight, a rogue-like / dungeon crawler set in a pastrified (turned into pastry) parallel world following a retired knight on his journey to save his daughter. The knight (player) must smash his way through pastry enemies and advance through the world.</p>
            <!-- ------------------------------------------ -->
            <h2>UI</h2>
            <!-- ---------------------- -->
            <h3>Main Menu</h3>

            <p>A list of content needed in the main menu was made by using other popular game&apos;s main menu content as inspiration. With the list done, I asked the concept artists to send me some of the concepts they had made so that i may use it in the menu page.</p>

            <p>I then moved on to designing the first mockups of the main menu using Figma (version 1 & 2) but none of them were appealing to me or the team, so after more inspiration and a play test where I got see the other teams games; I made the final version which was very well received in the team.</p>

            <div id="project-image-group-scroll">
                <div>
                    <img class="project-image" src="images/PastryKnight/Main Menu/Main menu V3.png" alt="">
                    <h2 class="project-image-title">Final</h2>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <img class="project-image" src="images/PastryKnight/Main Menu/Main menu V1.png" alt="">
                    <h2 class="project-image-title">Version 1 </h2>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <img class="project-image" src="images/PastryKnight/Main Menu/Main menu V2.png" alt="">
                    <h2 class="project-image-title">Version 2 </h2>
                </div>
            </div>
    
            <p>I thought that rather than overlay buttons on a background, making use of the background element (in this case the tree trunk) was a much more interesting way to display buttons. It is also something that I have not seen done much. I believe that with more time and game making knowledge the main menu could have pushed the use of the background as a menu even farther.</p>

            <!-- ---------------------- -->
            <h3>Option Screen</h3>

            <p>The options screen started in the same way as the main menu, we looked around at games we are familiar with and noted down the most common settings. Once I had a good list of settings I sat down with our programming team and checked which settings were feasible to have in the game and which were not. With a list in hand we did card sorting to categories them and be able to screen options accordingly.</p>

            <div id="project-image-group-scroll">
                <div>
                    <img class="project-image" src="images/PastryKnight/Option Menu/Options screen V4.png" alt="">
                    <h2 class="project-image-title">Final</h2>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <img class="project-image" src="images/PastryKnight/Option Menu/options screen V1.png" alt="">
                    <h2 class="project-image-title">Version 1 </h2>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <img class="project-image" src="images/PastryKnight/Option Menu/Options screen V2.png" alt="">
                    <h2 class="project-image-title">Version 2 </h2>
                </div>
            </div>
                <p>The first version of the options screen was done before the main menu was making use of the background to place buttons, therefore it was made in a way that does not match the final main menu. It made use of a tab system to separate the options. </p>
                <p>To match the main menu, the tree from the background expands to reveal the opinions screen and its different options. Version 2 made use of a tab system but after more discussion with the programming team some of the sections became very empty.</p>
                <p>In version 3 all the options where placed under one single tab and where sectioned off by headers itavoid having tabs with one single option in it.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately due to time constraint we had to cut a lot of the options that were not yet implemented, leaving us with the final options screen iteration.</p>
            <!-- ---------------------- -->
            <h3>Pause Menu & death screen</h3>

            <p>The pause screen was not given much thought until I had a final main menu version, therefore the pause screen uses the same idea of placing the buttons on the tree trunk. Since there was no background, I decided to use the current screen the game is using and blurring it; this help separate the game from the menu and give a layered feel.</p>

            <p>I felt it was necessary to have a proper death screen, it helps the player know what is going on. Rather than just teleporting them to the beginning and resetting the game, we gave them a moment to realise what happened. I wanted to keep the screen very simple so I only gave them the option to retry or to leave the main menu and potentially quit.</p>

            <div id="project-image-group">
                <div>
                    <img class="project-image" src="images/PastryKnight/Pause screen/Pause V2.png" alt="">
                    <h2 class="project-image-title">Pause menu</h2>

                    <h2 class="project-image-title">Death screen</h2>
                </div>
            </div>
            <!-- ---------------------- -->
            <h3>HUD</h3>
            <p>The process for the HUD (heads-up display) followed the same method as the other UI elements. I looked at inspirations from other games and tried things out. I presented it to the team and we voted on what we felt was the most appropriate one.</p>

            <p>The ability icons where the only thing we were sure from the start as to where they would be placed, I focused on how to show the health. I wanted to make it hard for the player to know how much health they have left, but after testing, a lot of the ways to show the health were not fitting the vibe we wanted as a team.</p>

            <p>At the time, I was a massive player of Elden ring. Elden ring's reputation for being some of the hardest games to be ever made. Since we wanted to make our game hard in terms of hard hitting enemies, I got inspired by their ways of displaying the health.</p>

            <h2 >What I learnt</h2>
            <p>This was a very fun project to work on with my class mates. I learnt a lot by exploring things by myself, I developed my skills as a UI designer but also got to learn a new programming language. I experience working in a team, having to communicate changes to other.</p>
