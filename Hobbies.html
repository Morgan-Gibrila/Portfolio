                <h1>Skateboarding</h1>
                <p>Ever since I was a child I have been skating. Over the years I have sadly had less time to go, but whenever I have a few hours free on sunny day i will always to the opportunity to go with my friend to skate.</p>

                <h1>Bouldering</h1>
                <p>I donâ€™t often go bouldering, but when I have the opportunity i will go with my friends as it reminds me of when I would go with my uncle when I was younger.</p>

                <h1>Video games</h1>
                <p>Since I am unable to go skate and bouldering anytime I want, I end up playing video games at night with my friends after doing my university work.</p>
